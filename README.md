# ISP project 

[Air Quality web application](https://airquality.onrender.com/)

The ISP project is colobration project from students at Metropolia UAS and Hochschule Osnabruck UAS. The project goal is creating an device and mutliple platform applications. The indoor air quality monitoring application is designed to provide users with real-time information about the quality of the air in their surroundings. This application is able to show key indicators of air quality, such as PM10, PM2.5, temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide levels, etc. and alert to users in case of hazardous conditions. The data collected by the application is displayed in an easy-to-read dashboard that allows users to quickly identify areas of concern and take action to improve the air quality.

The project has 2 seperate modules: hardware and software.

- Hardware: The first stage was built with supporting connection directly between device and android application. The second stage was build for supporting multi platform application and cloud. 
- Software: The project was built in multiple application: web, android and ios
